        <h2>Features of Java</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Object-Oriented</li>
            <li>Simple</li>
            <li> Portable</li>

         <dl>
          <dt>Object-Oriented</dt>  
          <dd><p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object.
             Object-oriented meanswe organize our software as a combination of different types of
              objects that incorporate both data and behavior.</p></dd>
              <ul>
                <li>Object</li>
                <li>Class</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>
              </ul>
         
         <dt>Simple</dt>  
          <dd><p>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.</p></dd>
         
         <dt>Portable</dt>  
          <dd><p>Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any
             platform. It doesn't require any implementation.</p></dd>

        <dt>Platform independent</dt>  
        <dd><p>Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc.
             which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, 
            run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.</p></dd>
         
        <dt>Secured</dt>  
        <dd><p>Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems</p></dd>

        <dt>Robust</dt>  
        <dd><p>The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because: </p></dd>
            <ul>
            <li>It uses strong memory management.</li>
            <li>There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.</li>
            
        </ul>
